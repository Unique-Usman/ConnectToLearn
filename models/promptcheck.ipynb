Interactive To-Do List: Create a dynamic to-do list using the DOM. Users should be able to add, delete, and mark tasks as complete. You can use JavaScript to manipulate the DOM and store the tasks in local storage for persistence.\\n\\n2. Image Gallery: Build an image gallery where users can upload and display their images. Use the DOM to dynamically create image elements and allow users to interact with the gallery by adding captions, sorting images, or applying filters.\\n\\n3. Quiz Application: Develop a quiz application using the DOM. Users should be able to answer multiple-choice questions, and the application should provide immediate feedback on their answers. Use the DOM to dynamically generate the quiz questions and track the user's score.\\n\\n4. Interactive Form Validation: Create a form with various input fields (text, email, password, etc.) and use the DOM to validate the user's input in real-time. Provide feedback to the user if the input is invalid and prevent form submission until all fields are correctly filled.\\n\\nRemember, these project ideas are just starting points, and you can customize them based on your interests and goals.
