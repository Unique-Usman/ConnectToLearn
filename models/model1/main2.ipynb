Consequently, we establish a connection between a three-dimensional icosahedral seed, a six-dimensional (6D) Dirichlet quantized host and a higher dimensional lattice structure. The 20G, owing to its icosahedral symmetry, bears the signature of a 6D lattice that manifests in the Dirichlet integer representation. We present an interpretation whereby the three-dimensional 20G can be regarded as the core substratum from which the higher dimensional lattices emerge. This emergent geometry is based on an induction principle supported by the Clifford multi-vector formalism of three-dimensional (3D) Euclidean space.

Reliable Energy Consumption Modeling for an Electric Vehicle Fleet - 2022\\\\n Accurately predicting the energy consumption of an electric vehicle (EV) under real-world circumstances (such as varying road, traffic, weather conditions, etc.) is critical for a number of decisions like range estimation and route planning. A major concern for electric vehicle owners is the uncertain nature of the battery consumption. This results in the “range anxiety” and reluctance from users for mass adoption of EVs, since they are concerned about untimely drainage of battery. Even at the organizational level, a company running a fleet of electric vehicles must understand the battery consumption profiles accurately for tasks such as route and driver planning, battery sizing, maintenance planning, etc. \\\\n\\\\n2.

Towards robust and efficient embodied visual perception - 2022\\\\nComputer vision has had tremendous success recently in perception tasks, especially, in cloud applications. An embodied system brings the additional objectives of memory, compute and energy optimization in addition to system accuracy. As opposed to processing in the cloud, an embodied agent has to perform in the wild without access to additional infrastructure. In this thesis, we address four major limitations of visual perception in embodied systems. From Images to Videos: When dealing with image streams, there is often redundancy in the temporal neighborhood since objects are often repeated. Thus, a frame-level analysis leans towards the objects present in a larger number of frames rather than a fair evaluation for all objects in a video. To mitigate this, we propose an evaluation metric that clubs together different appearances of each object from multiple frames.

To mitigate this, we propose an evaluation metric that clubs together different appearances of each object from multiple frames. In our work, we show how this results in metrics that are sensitive to bias against any objects in the videos. Resource Constrained Object Detection When object detectors run at different speeds while processing an image stream, a number of frames have to be skipped to maintain realtime operation. Thus, a faster but less accurate detector may be able to process more frames than a slower detector which may be more accurate at the frame level. It is unclear, however, which of these object detectors would be able to detect more objects. This shows the dependence of object detection performance on the speed at which the algorithms are run.

VmAP: A Fair Metric for Video Object Detection - 2021\\\\nVideo object detection is the task of detecting objects in a sequence of frames, typically, with a significant overlap in content among consecutive frames. Mean Average Precision (mAP) was originally proposed for evaluating object detection techniques in independent frames, but has been used for evaluating video based object detectors as well. This is undesirable since the average precision over all frames masks the biases that a certain object detector might have against certain types of objects depending on the number of frames for which the object is present in a video sequence. In this paper we show several disadvantages of mAP as a metric for evaluating video based object detection.

Surely, this is something to be welcomed and supported? However, this has come with its pitfalls. In the USA, it is now possible for children to emancipate themselves from their parents, becoming legally responsible for themselves before the age of 18. Currently there are no similar laws in the UK and the age of majority remains 18 years.

However, this general trend towards independence and freedom for the child, propelled by the child-rights discourse, has led to a disassociation of the child from the family unit.

Arguably, this is much more conducive to the health and wellbeing of the child and thus there is much that the Hindu approach to childhood can contribute to the current debate on child rights.\\\\n\\\\n3.

So what exactly is the debate on hyper-grace?

Of various levels of RAID discussed, RAID1 and RAID5 have become more popular. Mirroring or RAID1 maintains multiple copies of the data, generally provides best performance and is easier to configure. Rotating parity scheme or RAID5 is the least expensive RAID scheme with good large update performance. It suffers from poor small update performance and performance drops sharply when a diskfails and the array enters degraded mode. Configuring RAID5 is more involved. This paper presents the design and implementation of a host-based driver for a multi-tier RAID storage system, currently with 2 tiers: a small RAID1 tier and a larger RAID5 tier.

Copy elimination in functional languages - 1989\\\\nCopy elimination is an important optimization for compiling functional languages. Copies arise because these languages lack the concepts of state and variable; hence updating an object involves a copy in a naive implementation. Copies are also possible if proper targeting has not been carried out inside functions and across function calls. Targeting is the proper selection of a storage area for evaluating an expression. By abstracting a collection of functions by a target operator, we compute targets of function bodies that can then be used to define an optimized interpreter to eliminate copies due to updates and copies across function calls.

Overall, improved enforcement of credit contracts reduces the misallocation of factors of production—entrepreneurial skills, capital, and labor across production units—leading to increased aggregate productivity and output per capita of the economy.

Differential signaling of inducible nitric oxide synthase induction in Mycobacterium tuberculosis infected alveolar epithelial cell line A549 in response to cytokines IFN-γ\\xa0… - 2014\\\\nIn earlier studies, it was shown that ex vivo Mycobacterium tuberculosis-infected type II alveolar epithelial cells generate de novo nitric oxide (NO), but the mycobactericidal quantity of NO was released only by stimulation of these cells with proinflammatory cytokines, i.e. IFN-γ, TNF-α and IL-1β.

DNA bending propensity in the presence of base mismatches: implications for DNA repair - 2013\\\\nDNA bending is believed to facilitate the initial recognition of the mismatched base for repair. The repair efficiencies are dependent on both the mismatch type and neighboring nucleotide sequence. We have studied bending of several DNA duplexes containing canonical matches: A:T and G:C; various mismatches: A:A, A:C, G:A, G:G, G:T, C:C, C:T, and T:T; and a bis-abasic site: X:X. Free-energy profiles were generated for DNA bending using umbrella sampling.

We demonstrate that the particle fluctuations generated by the solitary-wave decay can be viewed as a granular analogue of temperature. Their presence is manifested by two emergent macroscopic properties absent in the unperturbed granular packing: a finite pressure that scales with the injected energy (akin to a granular temperature) and an anomalous viscosity that arises even when the microscopic mechanisms of energy dissipation are negligible.

Kinks in topological soft matter - 2014\\\\nWeakly connected mechanical systems near the isostatic threshold are fragile in the sense that they exhibit large deformations in response to tiny perturbations.

Our findings are corroborated with simulations. We then successfully extend this model to oblique interfaces, where we find that the angle of refraction and reflection of a solitary wave follows, below a critical value, an analogue of Snell’s law in which the solitary-wave speed replaces the speed of sound, which is zero in the sonic vacuum.\\\\n\\\\n9.

Solitary waves and fluctuations in fragile matter - 2013\\\\nIn this thesis, we study energy transport and fluctuations in simple models of fragile matter : a unique state of matter that has a vanishingly small window of linear response since one or both of its elastic moduli (shear and bulk) are nearly zero. As a consequence, even the tiniest perturbations travel as nonlinear waves. In addition, most models of fragile matter have an amorphous structure. It is the interaction of the non-linear waves with the underlying disorder and the resulting fluctuations, that constitutes the unifying theme explored in this thesis.

The interaction potential between elastic disks is given by the nonlinear Hertz law that has no harmonic part.

Of the four major ingredients necessary for their mixotrophic growth – light, carbon dioxide, organic carbon, and nitrogen source – light turns out to be a critical one. Low light intensity results in light-limited photosynthesis by depleting the light reactions of enough entrapped photons whose energy can be transmitted by excited electrons for conversion to chemical energy stored in the ATP molecules.

Micro-and meso-scale analyses for quantifying hypoxemia in methemoglobinemia - 2011\\\\nMethemoglobinemia is a disease that results from abnormally high levels of methemoglobin (MetHb) in the red blood cell (RBC) caused by simultaneous uptake of oxygen (O2) and nitric oxide (NO) in the human lungs.

MetHb is produced in the RBC by irreversible NO-induced oxidation of the oxygen carrying ferrous ion (Fe2+) in the heme group of the hemoglobin (Hb) molecule to its non-oxygen binding ferric state (Fe3+). In this paper, we study the role of NO in the pathophysiology of methemoglobinemia by performing a multiscale quantitative analysis of the relation between levels of NO inhaled by the patient and the hypoxemia resulting from the disease. Reactions of NO occurring in the RBC with both Hb and oxyhemoglobin are considered in conjunction with the usual reaction between oxygen and Hb to form oxyhemoglobin. Our dynamic simulations of NO and O2 uptake in the RBC and in the plasma in pulmonary capillaries under continuous, simultaneous exposure to both gases reveal that at the end of the pulmonary transit time of 1 s, the oxygen saturation in the RBC equilibrates at 97% in absence of NO but it shows a steady decline to 95% as the concentration of NO increases', metadata={'source': '../excel/faculty.xlsx'}), Document(page_content='that at the end of the pulmonary transit time of 1 s, the oxygen saturation in the RBC equilibrates at 97% in absence of NO but it shows a steady decline to 95% as the concentration of NO increases to 50 ppm. We further show that NO levels of 150 ppm or higher while breathing in room air may be considered to be fatal for methemoglobinemia patients since it causes severe hypoxemia by decreasing the oxygen saturation to below its critical value of 90%. Our analysis shows that the diagnosis of hypoxemia in methemoglobinemia cannot be done by measuring oxygen partial pressures in the patient’s pulmonary artery, but by estimating the oxygen saturation …\\\\n\\\\n39.

Chemotherapy has been recognized as a successful means of arresting cancer, which is the third biggest killer among humans. Cancerous tumors are characterized by their rapid spread across the diseased tissue and successively deteriorating conditions.

The least cost route to the destination subset also changes in some cases. Analytical results obtained for multicast network with correlated links is verified through simulations.\\\\n\\\\n105.

Enforcing cooperation in an ad hoc network using a cost-credit based forwarding and routing approach - 2007\\\\nAn ad hoc network is a wireless network constructed on a 'need-to-communicate' basis where the wireless nodes also have to support network infrastructure functions like routing. Since the nodes are likely to be power constrained, they will be reluctant to cooperate and use their limited power resources for forwarding packets for others.

This strategy is found to be efficient in designing a translucent optical network with sparse electronic switch placement that performs very close in blocking to that of an opaque optical network.

In our results, lightpath blocking as low as that with the fully opaque network case was obtained with electronic switches selectively placed at approximately one node in three on average. The heuristic also performs well against random searching for an effective subset of electronic switch nodes and performs better than a prior optimal method that is based on a combinatorially exhaustive search and that is limited to assuming fixed shortest-path routing.\\\\n\\\\n203.

This may cause problems of inefficiency, potential instability as well as a degradation in the quality of service offered to the customers. Augmenting this with the introduction of simple state-dependent control procedures provides systems which exhibit more desirable operational features. This approach is proposed and examined in this paper.\\\\n\\\\n254.

In the context of this system, this paper describes a protocol for these services and analyzes them for the realistic situation where the satellite transponder is power-limited. Using the bursty nature of voice, an “over-assignment” strategy is proposed to efficiently utilize the satellite's resources.

The mobiles use slotted ALOHA random access to send requests for channel assignments to a central station. For successful requests, the actual transmission of voice/data within a call is done using the channel assigned for this purpose by the central station. The satellite channel is assumed to be power limited. Taking into account the known burstiness of voice sources (which use a voice-activated switch), the central station overassigns channels so that the average total power is below the power limit of the satellite transponder.

Modular Spacecraft Architecture, a New Paradigm in Spacecraft Design - 2010\\\\nA monolithic spacecraft is one whose functional units, the subsystems that enable it to fulfill its mission, reside together inside a singular structure. In the recent years, other architectures for spacecraft design, such as the fractionated architecture, are being explored. In a fractionated architecture, the subsystems are distributed over geographically separate modules. These modules must work in close coordination with each other to fulfill the mission objectives.

A modular architecture consists of a network of payload and support modules flying in close coordination. In this respect, the architecture is similar to the fractionated architecture. However, in a modular architecture, all support modules are identical and provide a fraction of the support capability (eg. communication, data processing etc.) to the payload modules. Thus, the satellite can function at a reduced level of performance even in case of failure of one or more modules. This paper introduces the reader to the concept of modular spacecraft architecture and identifies metrics which the measure system value. It then compares and contrasts the performance of monolithic, fractionated and modular architectures against these metrics.

A hypothetical mission is considered and spacecraft are conceptually designed using the principles of monolithic, fractionated and modular architecture. Key parameters of each design-cost, weight and performance are evaluated and compared. A metric for measuring the system complexity, one of the primary factors behind cost and schedule over-runs of modern aerospace systems, is described. This is then used to assess the complexity of each design. Through this study, it can be concluded that even though fractionated and modular architecture have higher weight and cost they have a potential to provide greater flexibility and robustness in their design and operation. Further, adoption of modular architecture, with its ability to offer graceful degradation in performance, can provide greater robustness than fractionated architecture under certain operational scenarios.

Search for the ultimate regime in turbulent free convection: Rayleigh-Benard convection and axially homogenous convection in a vertical tube. - \\\\nWe consider two types of turbulent free convection. One is the classical Rayleigh-Benard (RB) convection, ie, the convection of unstably stratified fluid between two horizontal plates, and the other the convection of unstably stratified fluid in a long vertical tube (tube convection). In RB turbulent convection, most experiments, even at the highest Rayleigh number (Ra) achieved so far seem to show the classical Nu~ Ra1/3 scaling. The so called ‘ultimate’scaling Nu~ Ra1/2 predicted by Kraichnan seems to be elusive. However, in tube convection this regime is easily achieved.

A device for measuring the variable lateral bow angle and its impact on score loss - 2019\\\\nDuring competitions, archers lose points due to errors that vary linearly or quadratically according to the distance to a target. Minimizing the quadratic variables, such as bow cant variation, should result in improvements in an archer’s performance at longer distances in major competitions. Theoretically, a bow cant angle variation of 0.1° from shot to shot can significantly affect an individual’s score. However, this error factor has not been directly measured or observed. Thus, a wireless sensor suite was developed to measure the bow’s movements and confirm that such variations exist.

Hence, soft robotic devices have increasingly become an area of research for medical applications where patient safety is paramount. However, due to the high flexibility inherent in these devices, their flexural rigidity inhibits their ability to exert sufficient forces.

Results showed that this mechanism increased the stiffness by almost five folds. The simplicity of the concept will easily allow further optimization for its potential use in surgical-assist applications.\\\\n\\\\n31.

WRN helicase and mismatch repair complexes independently and synergistically disrupt cruciform DNA structures - 2023\\\\nThe Werner Syndrome helicase, WRN, is a promising therapeutic target in cancers with microsatellite instability (MSI). Long‐term MSI leads to the expansion of TA nucleotide repeats proposed to form cruciform DNA structures, which in turn cause DNA breaks and cell lethality upon WRN downregulation. Here we employed biochemical assays to show that WRN helicase can efficiently and directly unfold cruciform structures, thereby preventing their cleavage by the SLX1‐SLX4 structure‐specific endonuclease. TA repeats are particularly prone to form cruciform structures, explaining why these DNA sequences are preferentially broken in MSI cells upon WRN downregulation.

Role of p97/VCP (Cdc48) in genome stability - 2013\\\\nUbiquitin-dependent molecular chaperone p97, also known as valosin-containing protein (VCP) or Cdc48, is an AAA ATPase involved in protein turnover and degradation. p97 converts its own ATPase hydrolysis into remodeling activity on a myriad of ubiquitinated substrates from different cellular locations and pathways. In this way, p97 mediates extraction of targeted protein from cellular compartments or protein complexes. p97-dependent protein extraction from various cellular environments maintains cellular protein homeostasis. In recent years, p97-dependent protein extraction from chromatin has emerged as an essential evolutionarily conserved process for maintaining genome stability.

Delegation-based conversion from CPA to CCA-secure predicate encryption - 2020\\\\nIn 2011, Yamada et al. proposed CPA to CCA-secure conversions for attribute-based encryption (ABE) based on the properties, verifiability and delegation. Later, the verifiability-based conversion was generalised from ABE to predicate encryption (PE) by Yamada et al. (2012) and Nandi et al. (2017). We observe that for bilinear-pairing based PE schemes, the cost of CCA-decryption blows up to the double of the cost of CPA-decryption due to verifiability testing.

Signcryption in a quantum world - 2020\\\\nThis work studies signcryption of classical data in the quantum setting.

This CP-FE scheme is constructed based on attribute-based encryption (ABE) structure of Okamoto-Takashima in Asiacrypt, 2012. To achieve the adaptive security, we put bounds on number of occurrences of any symbol in a string and in the set of transition tuples of a DFA. Due to this restriction, the size of key space (where the keys are indexed with strings) is reduced to finite. Hence, the functional scope of any DFA in our system can capture only finite language.
