      "      1. Optimal Cycling of a Heterogenous Battery Bank via Reinforcement Learning - 2021\\nWe consider the problem of optimal charging/discharging of a bank of heterogenous battery units, driven by stochastic electricity generation and demand processes. The batteries in the battery bank may differ with respect to their capacities, ramp constraints, losses, as well as cycling costs. The goal is to minimize the degradation costs associated with battery cycling in the long run; this is posed formally as a Markov decision process. We propose a linear function approximation based Q-learning algorithm for learning the optimal solution, using a specially designed class of kernel functions that approximate the structure of the value functions associated with the MDP. The proposed algorithm is validated via an extensive case study.\\n\\n2. Statistical economies of scale in battery sharing - 2021\\nThe goal of this paper is to shed light on the statistical economies of scale achievable from the sharing of storage between multiple renewable generators. To demonstrate these economies in practice, we present an extensive study using real-world wind data from a grid of equispaced wind generators sharing a common battery. Each of these generators is in turn contracted to meet a certain demand profile to a prescribed level of reliability. Interestingly, the statistical diversity in wind generation across different locations yields useful economies of scale once the grid spacing exceeds 200 km. However, when the grid spacing exceeds 500 km, we find that the economies grow dramatically: The shared battery size becomes insensitive to the number of participating generators. This means that the generators can access a common, shared battery and collectively achieve the same reliability they would have, had each of … \\n\\n3. Sizing storage for reliable renewable integration: A large deviations approach - 2020\\nThe inherent intermittency of wind and solar generation presents a significant challenge as we seek to increase the penetration of renewable generation in the power grid. Increasingly, energy storage is being deployed alongside renewable generation to counter this intermittency. However, a formal characterization of the reliability of renewable generators bundled with storage is lacking in the literature. The present paper seeks to fill this gap. We use a Markov modulated fluid queue to model the loss of load probability (LOLP) associated with a renewable generator bundled with a battery, serving an uncertain demand process. Further, we characterize the asymptotic behavior of the LOLP as the battery size scales to infinity. Our results shed light on the fundamental limits of reliability achievable, and also guide the sizing of the storage required in order to meet a given reliability target. Finally, we present a case study …\\n\\n4. Pareto-optimal energy sharing between battery-equipped renewable generators - 2020\\nThe inherent intermittency of renewable sources like wind and solar has resulted in a bundling of renewable generators with storage resources (batteries) for increased reliability. In this paper, we consider the problem of energy sharing between two such bundles, each associated with their own demand profiles. The demand profiles might, for example, correspond to commitments made by the bundle to the grid. With each bundle seeking to minimize its loss of load rate, we explore the possibility that one bundle can supply energy to the other from its battery at times of deficit, in return for a reciprocal supply from the other when it faces a deficit itself. We show that there always exist mutually beneficial energy sharing arrangements between the two bundles. Moreover, we show that Pareto-optimal arrangements involve at least one bundle transferring energy to the other at the maximum feasible rate at times of deficit …\\n\\n5.

Low cost hardware-in-loop for automotive application - 2015\\nHardware-in-loop (HiL) simulation focuses on testing of Electronic Control Units (ECU) in virtual real time environment in order to scrutinize the behavior of controller under test. Use of HiL simulation in development process reduces time and cost involved in verification and validation of the ECU's development. Generally, HiL systems developed using dSPACE®, National Instruments® and other platforms used in automotive industry are very costly and sophisticated. For less complex systems a low cost HiL testing approach using an existing target hardware can be opted. It may or may not be possible to use existing hardware, as there might be limitations in the availability of pin count, on-chip peripherals etc. This paper discusses a case study of Electronic Speed Limiter (ESL) where a low-cost HiL testing technique is being implemented for verification and validation of ESL. The ESL HiL system developed using …\\n\\n7. Hardware in the loop for electronic speed limiter - 2015\\nElectronic controller unit (ECU) used for controlling sub-systems of complex real life applications like automotive vehicles can pose several challenges. Many times one needs to plan development and testing of controller, when the end vehicle is also under development and hence not available. In such case, hardware in the loop (HIL) approach for testing such controllers emulates the external application environment and allows concurrent development of the electronic controllers. Even when the end vehicle is available, if design iterations are to be carried out using \"in-vehicle\" testing approach, then the same can be time-consuming. Such an approach may also possess safety hazards if malfunction of the ECU impacts occupants/vehicle safety. Many cases require simulation of a range of use-case scenarios as well as system operation under diverse set of environments. For example, for a power-train related …\\n\n",

      "      1. Optimal Cycling of a Heterogenous Battery Bank via Reinforcement Learning - 2021\\nWe consider the problem of optimal charging/discharging of a bank of heterogenous battery units, driven by stochastic electricity generation and demand processes. The batteries in the battery bank may differ with respect to their capacities, ramp constraints, losses, as well as cycling costs. The goal is to minimize the degradation costs associated with battery cycling in the long run; this is posed formally as a Markov decision process. We propose a linear function approximation based Q-learning algorithm for learning the optimal solution, using a specially designed class of kernel functions that approximate the structure of the value functions associated with the MDP. The proposed algorithm is validated via an extensive case study.\\n\\n2. Statistical economies of scale in battery sharing - 2021\\nThe goal of this paper is to shed light on the statistical economies of scale achievable from the sharing of storage between multiple renewable generators. To demonstrate these economies in practice, we present an extensive study using real-world wind data from a grid of equispaced wind generators sharing a common battery. Each of these generators is in turn contracted to meet a certain demand profile to a prescribed level of reliability. Interestingly, the statistical diversity in wind generation across different locations yields useful economies of scale once the grid spacing exceeds 200 km. However, when the grid spacing exceeds 500 km, we find that the economies grow dramatically: The shared battery size becomes insensitive to the number of participating generators. This means that the generators can access a common, shared battery and collectively achieve the same reliability they would have, had each of … \\n\\n3. Sizing storage for reliable renewable integration: A large deviations approach - 2020\\nThe inherent intermittency of wind and solar generation presents a significant challenge as we seek to increase the penetration of renewable generation in the power grid. Increasingly, energy storage is being deployed alongside renewable generation to counter this intermittency. However, a formal characterization of the reliability of renewable generators bundled with storage is lacking in the literature. The present paper seeks to fill this gap. We use a Markov modulated fluid queue to model the loss of load probability (LOLP) associated with a renewable generator bundled with a battery, serving an uncertain demand process. Further, we characterize the asymptotic behavior of the LOLP as the battery size scales to infinity. Our results shed light on the fundamental limits of reliability achievable, and also guide the sizing of the storage required in order to meet a given reliability target. Finally, we present a case study …\\n\\n4. Pareto-optimal energy sharing between battery-equipped renewable generators - 2020\\nThe inherent intermittency of renewable sources like wind and solar has resulted in a bundling of renewable generators with storage resources (batteries) for increased reliability. In this paper, we consider the problem of energy sharing between two such bundles, each associated with their own demand profiles. The demand profiles might, for example, correspond to commitments made by the bundle to the grid. With each bundle seeking to minimize its loss of load rate, we explore the possibility that one bundle can supply energy to the other from its battery at times of deficit, in return for a reciprocal supply from the other when it faces a deficit itself. We show that there always exist mutually beneficial energy sharing arrangements between the two bundles. Moreover, we show that Pareto-optimal arrangements involve at least one bundle transferring energy to the other at the maximum feasible rate at times of deficit …\\n\\n5.

Low cost hardware-in-loop for automotive application - 2015\\nHardware-in-loop (HiL) simulation focuses on testing of Electronic Control Units (ECU) in virtual real time environment in order to scrutinize the behavior of controller under test. Use of HiL simulation in development process reduces time and cost involved in verification and validation of the ECU's development. Generally, HiL systems developed using dSPACE®, National Instruments® and other platforms used in automotive industry are very costly and sophisticated. For less complex systems a low cost HiL testing approach using an existing target hardware can be opted. It may or may not be possible to use existing hardware, as there might be limitations in the availability of pin count, on-chip peripherals etc. This paper discusses a case study of Electronic Speed Limiter (ESL) where a low-cost HiL testing technique is being implemented for verification and validation of ESL. The ESL HiL system developed using …\\n\\n7. Hardware in the loop for electronic speed limiter - 2015\\nElectronic controller unit (ECU) used for controlling sub-systems of complex real life applications like automotive vehicles can pose several challenges. Many times one needs to plan development and testing of controller, when the end vehicle is also under development and hence not available. In such case, hardware in the loop (HIL) approach for testing such controllers emulates the external application environment and allows concurrent development of the electronic controllers. Even when the end vehicle is available, if design iterations are to be carried out using \"in-vehicle\" testing approach, then the same can be time-consuming. Such an approach may also possess safety hazards if malfunction of the ECU impacts occupants/vehicle safety. Many cases require simulation of a range of use-case scenarios as well as system operation under diverse set of environments. For example, for a power-train related …\\n\n",

      "      1. Optimal Cycling of a Heterogenous Battery Bank via Reinforcement Learning - 2021\\nWe consider the problem of optimal charging/discharging of a bank of heterogenous battery units, driven by stochastic electricity generation and demand processes. The batteries in the battery bank may differ with respect to their capacities, ramp constraints, losses, as well as cycling costs. The goal is to minimize the degradation costs associated with battery cycling in the long run; this is posed formally as a Markov decision process. We propose a linear function approximation based Q-learning algorithm for learning the optimal solution, using a specially designed class of kernel functions that approximate the structure of the value functions associated with the MDP. The proposed algorithm is validated via an extensive case study.\\n\\n2. Statistical economies of scale in battery sharing - 2021\\nThe goal of this paper is to shed light on the statistical economies of scale achievable from the sharing of storage between multiple renewable generators. To demonstrate these economies in practice, we present an extensive study using real-world wind data from a grid of equispaced wind generators sharing a common battery. Each of these generators is in turn contracted to meet a certain demand profile to a prescribed level of reliability. Interestingly, the statistical diversity in wind generation across different locations yields useful economies of scale once the grid spacing exceeds 200 km. However, when the grid spacing exceeds 500 km, we find that the economies grow dramatically: The shared battery size becomes insensitive to the number of participating generators. This means that the generators can access a common, shared battery and collectively achieve the same reliability they would have, had each of … \\n\\n3. Sizing storage for reliable renewable integration: A large deviations approach - 2020\\nThe inherent intermittency of wind and solar generation presents a significant challenge as we seek to increase the penetration of renewable generation in the power grid. Increasingly, energy storage is being deployed alongside renewable generation to counter this intermittency. However, a formal characterization of the reliability of renewable generators bundled with storage is lacking in the literature. The present paper seeks to fill this gap. We use a Markov modulated fluid queue to model the loss of load probability (LOLP) associated with a renewable generator bundled with a battery, serving an uncertain demand process. Further, we characterize the asymptotic behavior of the LOLP as the battery size scales to infinity. Our results shed light on the fundamental limits of reliability achievable, and also guide the sizing of the storage required in order to meet a given reliability target. Finally, we present a case study …\\n\\n4. Pareto-optimal energy sharing between battery-equipped renewable generators - 2020\\nThe inherent intermittency of renewable sources like wind and solar has resulted in a bundling of renewable generators with storage resources (batteries) for increased reliability. In this paper, we consider the problem of energy sharing between two such bundles, each associated with their own demand profiles. The demand profiles might, for example, correspond to commitments made by the bundle to the grid. With each bundle seeking to minimize its loss of load rate, we explore the possibility that one bundle can supply energy to the other from its battery at times of deficit, in return for a reciprocal supply from the other when it faces a deficit itself. We show that there always exist mutually beneficial energy sharing arrangements between the two bundles. Moreover, we show that Pareto-optimal arrangements involve at least one bundle transferring energy to the other at the maximum feasible rate at times of deficit …\\n\\n5.

Low cost hardware-in-loop for automotive application - 2015\\nHardware-in-loop (HiL) simulation focuses on testing of Electronic Control Units (ECU) in virtual real time environment in order to scrutinize the behavior of controller under test. Use of HiL simulation in development process reduces time and cost involved in verification and validation of the ECU's development. Generally, HiL systems developed using dSPACE®, National Instruments® and other platforms used in automotive industry are very costly and sophisticated. For less complex systems a low cost HiL testing approach using an existing target hardware can be opted. It may or may not be possible to use existing hardware, as there might be limitations in the availability of pin count, on-chip peripherals etc. This paper discusses a case study of Electronic Speed Limiter (ESL) where a low-cost HiL testing technique is being implemented for verification and validation of ESL. The ESL HiL system developed using …\\n\\n7. Hardware in the loop for electronic speed limiter - 2015\\nElectronic controller unit (ECU) used for controlling sub-systems of complex real life applications like automotive vehicles can pose several challenges. Many times one needs to plan development and testing of controller, when the end vehicle is also under development and hence not available. In such case, hardware in the loop (HIL) approach for testing such controllers emulates the external application environment and allows concurrent development of the electronic controllers. Even when the end vehicle is available, if design iterations are to be carried out using \"in-vehicle\" testing approach, then the same can be time-consuming. Such an approach may also possess safety hazards if malfunction of the ECU impacts occupants/vehicle safety. Many cases require simulation of a range of use-case scenarios as well as system operation under diverse set of environments. For example, for a power-train related …\\n\n",
