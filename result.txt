8. POTENTIAL IMPACTS OF VARIOUS COASTAL LOCALES ON THE PHYTOCHEMICAL LANDSCAPE IN SAND DUNE FLORA CALOTROPIS GIGANTEAWHITE ACROSS THE COLEROON VALLEY - 2019
Calotropis gigantea has been well recognized as sand dune flora in the conservation aspect of coastal biota. However, little is known about the eco-geographical diversities in the phytochemical composition of white floral variety. The present study deals with gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) phytochemical profiling in methanol extracts of white flower collected from seven different coastal locations across Coleroon valley. The intraspecific diversity was observed in 37 phytoconstituents whereas 23 common profiles were found in C. gigantea white. The most dominant classes were found as alcohols, terpenoids, fatty acid esters, aliphatic hydrocarbons, and amines. The major common peaks included n-hexadecanoic acid and glycerin (13.2%), A’-neogammacer-22 (29)-en-3-ol, acetate,(3. beta., 21. beta.)(10.42%), 12-oleanen-3-yl acetate,(3. alpha.)-(10.28%), Hop-22 (29)-en-3-ol, acetate,(3. beta.)-(9.83%),. beta.-Amyrin (7.53%), 3-ethoxy-1, 2, propane-diol (15.82%) and ethyl Oleate (7.07%). The location-specific compounds such as erythritol, tetrahydrocannabinol carbonic acid-D3-HFBAPFPOH-derivative (THC), 1-nitro-propanol, oleic acid, Urs-20-en-3-ol,(3. beta. 18. alpha. 19. alpha), thiodiglycol, mercaptamine were obtained with major peaks from the respective locations (L1-L7).

9. DISPARITIES AND SIMILARITIES IN THE PHYTOCHEMICAL PROFILING OF WHITE CALOTROPIS GIGANTEALEAVES AMASSED FROM SIX COASTAL LOCALES ACROSS COLEROON DELTA - 2019
Calotropis gigantea white is a medicinal shrub principally utilized by the rural population from the traditional period. The plant can grow in numerous environments such as fresh and saline water terrestrial plains notably most abundant in the sand dune associated coastal areas. However, the eco-geographical divergences and commonalities in the phytochemical composition of white gigantea leaves remain largely unexplained. In this context, the present study is aimed to identify the bioactive compounds present in the methanol leaf extract by using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. The disease-free healthy leaves of the plant were collected from six different coastal locations across the Coleroon delta. The phytochemical analysis revealed the most abundant location-specific and common components among all locations. The predominance of alkanes, alkenes, heterocycles, alcohol, and silicon derivatives were also observed in the preliminary screening based on their functional groups. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to screen phytochemicals from the leaves of coastal white vegetation of C. gigantea among various locations across natural habitats Further investigations are required for the comparative study of bioactive metabolites to establish the medicinal values of white gigantea leaves in ecological aspects.

20. ANTI-FUNGAL ACTIVITY OF LEPTADENIA RETICULATA IN RAT ANIMAL MODEL IN VIVO - 2008
Leptadenia reticulata is a small erect or twining shrub belongs to family Asclepiadaceae and it is used as a medicine for various ailments. An attempt was made in this work to study the ethanolic extract (50%) of aerial part of the plant material was subjected to screen antifungal activity against the Aspergillus flavus in rat animal model invivo. In the present work the open wound infected with A. flavus was treated with L. reticulata extract for 8 days. This treated wound showed visible healing sign and the swab made from the healing wound region showed absence of the fungal hyphae. But in the infected but untreated group the wound was progressed and the animal was in distress and could account for 40% mortality within 8-days. The swab made from the wound region of the survived rats showed the presence of A. flavus hyphae. In the treated group WBC, Polymorphs and lymphocytes count were increased and eosinophylls count was reduced when compared to untreated group. From this result we conclude the ethanolic extract of L. reticulata posses antifungal activity against to the A. flavus.
